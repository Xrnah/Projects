## Smart_Home
We are given a goal to create a project that integrates at least 2 sensors and a logical output from the sensor.  

Proposal: Smart Room Management System  
Sensors: IR Sensor & Temperature/Humidity Sensor  
Output: Lights & Fans  

Course: <ins>**ELEX3**</ins> & <ins>**DELX1**</ins>  
Year/Term: Y2T2  

## Aeroponic_SYS
We are tasked to use a microcontroller to manage a physical project.  
Proposal: Automated Aeroponics  

Course: <ins>**DELX2**</ins>  
Year/Term: Y2T3  

## ECE221_Weather_Station
The project is synthesized from the requirement of having a 'feedback & control system [(Project Brief)](Documentation/Documents/IoT-Based%20Weather%20Station%20Monitoring%20Temperature,%20Humidity,%20Rain,%20Flood,%20and%20Pollution%20using%20ESP32%20and%20Blynk.pdf)'.  

Course: <ins>**FDCNLAB**</ins>  
Year/Term: Y3T1  

## Indoor Air Quality Monitoring
Part of a larger project, I am tasked to handle the integration of 4 pollutant sensors in a custom 3D printed base.  

Sensors:
- MQ131 (Ozone)
- Grove: VOC and eCO2 Gas Sensor
- Grove: Multichannel Gas Sensor v2
- Grove: All-in-one Environmental Sensor  

MCU:
- Arduino UNO R4 Minima
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B  

MCU Module:
- SeeedStudio: Arduino Base Shield v2 

Course: <ins>**ECEMETH**</ins> - <ins>**ECECAP1**</ins> - <ins>**ECECAP2**</ins>  
Year/Term: Y3T1-Y3T3  

## Centralized ACU Controller (On Progress)
> The agreed requirement to pass capstone.  

Part of the project series: Building Energy Management  
This project aims to develop a dashboard to control and visualize the ACUs running in the rooms being monitored.
