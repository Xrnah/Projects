# APC - SoE
Collection of college projects done within 2021 - 2026.

## Smart_Home
We are given a goal to create a project that integrates at least 2 sensors and an output from the sensor.
Proposal: Smart Room Management System
Sensors: IR Sensor & Temperature/Humidity Sensor
Output: Lights & Fans

Course: **ELEX3** & **DELX1**
Year/Term: Y2T2

## Aeroponic_SYS
We are tasked to use a microcontroller to manage a physical project.
Proposal: Automated Aeroponics

Course: **DELX2**
Year/Term: Y2T3

## ECE221_Weather_Station
The project is synthesised from the requirement of having a 'feedback & control system'.
